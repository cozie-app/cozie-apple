## What is Cozie?

Cozie is an iOS App for for human comfort data collection. 
It is extremely useful for conducting right-here-right-now surveys in buildings. It can, however, be used to ask questions in other settings, allowing people to provide feedback in real-time.

Cozie for iOS builds on the knowledge that the [BUDS Lab](https://www.budslab.org/) and [SinBerBEST](https://sinberbest.berkeley.edu) gained in developing [Cozie for Fitbit](https://cozie.app).
