## Download the data collected using the Cozie Apple Watch survey

You can download the data you have collected using the Cozie Apple Watch survey using the following Python code.
Please note that you will have to specify your `ID_PARTICIPANT`, `ID_EXPERIMENT` and `API_KEY`.
Therefore, it is very important that you have successfully completed Step 5 in [Instructions for testers](installation.md).
You can get these information by emailing us at cozie.app@gmail.com

All the data you have queried are saved inside the Pandas dataframe called `df`.

```
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Settings
YOUR_TIMEZONE = 'Asia/Singapore'
ID_PARTICIPANT = 'ExternalUser'
ID_EXPERIMENT = 'AppleStore'
WEEKS = "2"  # Number of weeks from which the data is retrived, starting from now
API_KEY = '' # reach out to cozie.app@gmail.com for an API_KEY

# Query data
payload = {'id_participant': ID_PARTICIPANT,'id_experiment': ID_EXPERIMENT, 'weeks': WEEKS}
headers = {"Accept": "application/json", 'x-api-key': API_KEY}
response = requests.get('https://m7cy76lxmi.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/default/cozie-apple-researcher-read-influx', params=payload, headers=headers)
data = json.loads(response.content)

# Convert response in Pandas Dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data).T
df.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index, unit='ms')
df.index = df.index.tz_localize('UTC').tz_convert(YOUR_TIMEZONE)
pd.options.display.max_columns = None

# Display dataframe
df.head()
```

### Watch survey data
If you want to focus on the analysis of the watch-based survey data use the code below to filter the dataframe retrieved above.

```
# Get only question flow responses
df_questions = df[~df["vote_count"].isna()]
df_questions.style
```

### Physiological data
Use the code below to plot noise and heart rate data contained in the dataframe retrieved above. 

```
# Plot time-series data
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize =(15, 7))

# Heart rate
df["heart_rate"].plot(ax=ax[0], style='.')
ax[0].set_title("Heart Rate", fontsize=18)
ax[0].set_ylabel("Heart Rate [bpm]", fontsize=14)
ax[0].set_xlabel("Time", fontsize=14)

# Sound pressure
df["sound_pressure"].plot(ax=ax[1], style='.')
ax[1].set_title("Sound Pressure", fontsize=18)
ax[1].set_ylabel("Sound Pressure [dB?]", fontsize=14)
ax[1].set_xlabel("Time", fontsize=14)
```
